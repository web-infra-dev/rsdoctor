## How to use only a specific feature of Rsdoctor?

When we **only need** the [bundle size analysis](../usage/bundle-size) feature of Rsdoctor, we can configure the corresponding [Features](/config/options/options) option when integrating the Rsdoctor plugin. Refer to the code snippet below:

```ts
import { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin';

new RsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
  features: ['bundle'], // Represents enabling only the bundle size analysis feature
});
```

## Loader time-consuming data is inaccurate?

The time-consuming data provided by Rsdoctor for loaders is an **estimated time**. Why can't it accurately measure the timing? It's because we know that loader execution can be both **asynchronous** and **synchronous**.
Additionally, the builder will **parallelize the execution** of multiple non-conflicting loader functions. Since JavaScript is single-threaded, multiple loader functions can **compete for the current task queue**.
Furthermore, the asynchronous logic within loader functions cannot be recognized, causing a single loader function to potentially span across the execution of multiple other loaders. As a result, there are three possible cases, as shown in the following diagram:

  style={{ width: '250px' }}
/>

Therefore, the loader timing provided by Rsdoctor is an **estimate**. The timing data we provide is adapted to handle Case 1 and Case 2 from the diagram. As for Case 3, we are still exploring solutions.

## `out of memory` error when using `Rsdoctor` for building

If you encounter an `out of memory` error, you can try the following two methods, with the first one being recommended:

### Method 1

Increase the memory limit of Node, for example: NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8096.

### Method 2

You can add the `lite` field to the `features` array to use the lite mode. Additionally, since the `features` array overrides the default configuration when it is an array, you should:

- Add `loader` and `plugins` to the `features` array if you need build-time analysis to enable the analysis of loader and plugin timings.

- Add `bundle` to the `features` array if you need bundle analysis to enable the analysis of build artifacts.

The following example enables the lite mode, build-time analysis, and bundle analysis:

```js
const { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin');

// adding the plugin to your configuration
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new RsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
      disableClientServer: false,
      features: ['lite', 'loader', 'plugins', 'bundle'],
    }),
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

- Cause: During the build process, the source code information is stored, which exceeds the memory limit. Enabling the `lite` mode can alleviate this issue.
- Difference: The difference between the **lite mode** and the **normal mode** is that the **lite mode** no longer stores the **source code information**, only the **bundled code** is stored. Additionally, the code displayed in the analysis report will only consist of the **bundled code**.
