# CLI Tutorial

We provide `@rsdoctor/cli` for you to use Rsdoctor's features locally through the CLI program.

`@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin`, `@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin`, and `@rsdoctor/cli` should have the same major and minor versions.

## Install @rsdoctor/cli

:::tip

- @rsdoctor/cli & @rsdoctor/webpack-plugin & @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin >= 0.1.2.
- You can also use the non-installation method by using the `npx @rsdoctor/cli <command> [options]` command.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'rspress/theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/cli -D" />

## Command Usage

```linux

rsdoctor <command> [options]

```

`@rsdoctor/cli` currently provides the following commands for different functionalities:

### analyze Command

The `analyze` command is mainly used to load the [manifest.json](../../config/options/term.mdx) file locally and start Rsdoctor's analysis report page without the need to rebuild.

```linux
rsdoctor analyze --profile <manifestFile>
```

**Parameter Definition**

- `manifestFile` is the path to the [manifest.json](../../config/options/term.mdx) file (supports local path)

**Usage Example**

```bash
rsdoctor analyze --profile "./dist/.rsdoctor/manifest.json"
```

## Node API

We provide a Node.js API in `@rsdoctor/cli` that allows you to make calls during runtime in Node.js.

**Importing the Module**

<Tabs>

<Tab label="cjs">

```js
const { execute } = require('@rsdoctor/cli');
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="esm">

```js
import { execute } from '@rsdoctor/cli';
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

**execute()**

The `execute` asynchronous function is the execution function of Rsdoctor CLI. By calling the `execute` function, it will automatically parse [process.argv](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/process.html#processargv) and invoke different commands.

**execute('analyze', \{...\})**

If you need to directly execute the [analyze command](#analyze-command) through the Node.js API, you can call it as follows:

```ts
execute('analyze', {
  profile: 'input the manifest.json path or url',
}).then((sdk) => {
  console.log('execute "anaylze" command success');
  // you can stop the Rsdoctor's dev-server by calling the sdk'api below:
  // sdk.dispose();
});
```
