# Introduction

## What is Rsdoctor?

**Rsdoctor is a one-stop tool for diagnosing and analyzing build processes and build artifacts**, and it supports the diagnosis and analysis of multiple front-end libraries when used in projects to help developers quickly discover and solve problems.

By using Rsdoctor, you can see more intuitive project problem diagnosis information and in-depth analysis of more specific project problems, such as:

- More intuitively see the link and packaging reasons for **duplicate packages** being parsed
- In-depth analysis of the calling **process of the Webpack Loader and optimization of build time**
- More clearly know the link and reason why this line of code has not been Tree Shaking.
- ...

At present, the front-end libraries we support mainly include the following two types, which you can access and use in the following libraries:

- Build-related:
  - [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev)
  - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
  - [Modern.js](https://modernjs.dev/builder)
