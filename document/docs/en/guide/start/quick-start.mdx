# Quick Start

This document will explain how to access the Rsdoctor ability.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

### Rspack Projects

For projects based on Rspack or Rsbuild, install the following dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin -D" />

### Webpack Projects

For projects based on Webpack, install the following dependencies:

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/webpack-plugin -D" />

---

## Step 2: Register Plugin

After the dependency installation is completed, you need to integrate the Rsdoctor plugin into the project. You can configure it according to the corresponding configuration guide based on the project framework.

### Rspack

We need to initialize the RsdoctorRspackPlugin in the [plugins](https://www.rspack.dev/config/plugins.html#plugins) of `rspack.config.js`, referring to the following code:

```js
const { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    process.env.RSDOCTOR && // It is recommended to execute the analysis plugin when RSDOCTOR is true, because the plugin may increase the build time.
      new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
        disableClientServer: !!process.env.DISABLE_CLIENT_SERVER,
      }), // Details of the plugin's options are provided below.
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

Next, when you execute the **build** command within the project and complete the build, Rsdoctor will automatically open the analysis page of the build results.

- **Options Config**

Please refer to [Options Configuration](../../config/options/index) for Options configuration items.

### Webpack

We need to initialize the RsdoctorWebpackPlugin in the [plugins](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/plugins/#plugins) of `webpack.config.js`, referring to the following code:

```js
const { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    process.env.RSDOCTOR && // It is recommended to execute the analysis plugin when RSDOCTOR is true, because the plugin may increase the build time.
      new RsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
        disableClientServer: !!process.env.DISABLE_CLIENT_SERVER,
      }), // Details of the plugin's options are provided below.
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

Next, when you execute the **build** command within the project and complete the build, Rsdoctor will automatically open the analysis page of the build results.

- **Options Config**

Please refer to [Options Configuration](../../config/options/index) for Options configuration items.

### Modern.js Framework

We need to initialize the RsdoctorWebpackPlugin in the [tools.bundlerChain](https://modernjs.dev/configure/app/tools/bundler-chain.html#toolsbundlerchain) of `modern.config.ts`, referring to the following code:

```js
import { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin';

module.exports = {
  // ...
  tools: {
    bundlerChain: (chain) => {
      if (process.env.RSDOCTOR) {
        // It is recommended to execute the analysis plugin when RSDOCTOR is true, because the plugin may increase the build time.
        chain.plugin('rsdoctor').use(RsdoctorWebpackPlugin, [
          {
            disableClientServer: !!process.env.DISABLE_CLIENT_SERVER,
          }, // Details of the plugin's options are provided below.
        ]);
      }
    },
  },
};
```

Next, when you execute the **build** command within the project and complete the build, Rsdoctor will automatically open the analysis page of the build results.

- **Options Config**

Please refer to [Options Configuration](../../config/options/index) for Options configuration items.

### Rsbuild Framework

We need to initialize the RsdoctorWebpackPlugin in the [tools.bundlerChain](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/basic/configure-rspack#toolsbundlerchain) of `rsbuild.config.ts`, referring to the following code:

```js
import { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin';

module.exports = {
  // ...
  tools: {
    bundlerChain: (chain) => {
      if (process.env.RSDOCTOR) {
        // It is recommended to execute the analysis plugin when RSDOCTOR is true, because the plugin may increase the build time.
        chain.plugin('rsdoctor').use(RsdoctorWebpackPlugin, [
          {
            disableClientServer: !!process.env.DISABLE_CLIENT_SERVER,
          }, // Details of the plugin's options are provided below.
        ]);
      }
    },
  },
};
```

Next, when you execute the **build** command within the project and complete the build, Rsdoctor will automatically open the analysis page of the build results.

- **Options Config**
