# @rsdoctor/mcp-server

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README.zh-CN.md)

## Introduction

@rsdoctor/mcp-server is an MCP Server designed to help users more conveniently utilize Rsdoctor's build data. It works with Rsdoctor's local build analysis data and helps you quickly obtain build analysis results through a Q&A interface.

## Features

Currently supports four main types of analysis capabilities:

- **Build Artifact Analysis**: Analyzes the size and composition of build artifacts
- **Dependency Analysis**: Analyzes project dependencies and duplicate dependency issues
- **Bundle Optimization Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for bundle size optimization and code splitting
- **Build Performance Suggestions**: Analyzes build time and provides build performance optimization suggestions

## Examples

### 1. Bundle Optimization Analysis

By asking "Please help me to optimize the bundle or artifacts", the tool will analyze the build artifacts and provide optimization suggestions.

### 2. Dependency Analysis

By asking "Please investigate the referrer dependency of node_modules/dayjs/index.js", the tool will analyze the dependency relationships of the specified module.

### 3. Build Performance Analysis

By asking "Please help me find files or loaders with high compilation time and provide optimization suggestions", the tool will analyze build time and provide optimization suggestions.

## Configuration

### Parameters

#### compiler

- Configure the name of the linked bundler (optional)

For multi-compiler projects, since each compiler will have its own Rsdoctor build analysis data, you need to configure the compiler parameter to specify which bundler's Rsdoctor data the mcp-server should analyze. Rsdoctor-mcp do not currently support analyzing multiple Rsdoctor data sets simultaneously.

```linux
npx @rsdoctor/mcp-server@latest --compiler [compilerName]
```

#### port

- Configure the port (optional)

```linux
npx -y @rsdoctor/mcp-server@latest --port 9988
```

Note: By default, the Rsdoctor local server starts on a random port. Therefore, if you want to use the port parameter, you need to configure the port in the plugin:

```js
new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
  port: 9988,
});
```

## Usage

### Version Requirements

The following Rsdoctor plugins are required (version requirements):

- @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin >= 1.1.2
- @rsdoctor/webpack-plugin >= 1.1.2

**Note: Please ensure you are using the latest version for the best experience.**

### 1. Plugin Configuration

If you haven't added the Rsdoctor plugin yet, you'll need to configure it in your project, [üëâüèª Quick Start](https://rsdoctor.rs/guide/start/quick-start).

### 2. Enable Rsdoctor and Run Local Build

With Rsdoctor enabled, execute the build process. **Do not use the MCP Client to start the project, as Rsdoctor's local server will block the MCP Client's conversation process.**

```linux
npm run build
```

- Note: If you have set `disableClientServer: true`, change it to `disableClientServer: false`. By default, disableClientServer is set to false.

### 3. Configure MCP Client

#### Claude

Add the following configuration to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsdoctor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@rsdoctor/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, you can interact directly with Rsdoctor's build analysis data in the MCP panel of Cursor, asking questions about artifacts, dependencies, optimizations, and more.

### Cursor

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=rsdoctor&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEByc2RvY3Rvci9tY3Atc2VydmVyQGxhdGVzdCJ9)

To integrate @rsdoctor/mcp-server in the Cursor editor, usually you only need to add the server configuration in the `.cursor/mcp.json` file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsdoctor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@rsdoctor/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, you can interact directly with Rsdoctor's build analysis data in the MCP panel of Cursor, asking questions about artifacts, dependencies, optimizations, and more.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Rsdoctor_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=ffffff)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22rsdoctor%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22%40rsdoctor%2Fmcp-server%40latest%22%5D%7D)

1. Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root directory. GitHub Copilot will automatically load the MCP Server configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsdoctor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@rsdoctor/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. In the Copilot Chat view, select [Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode#_use-agent-mode), then start interacting.

### Cline

Add the MCP Server configuration in the Cline configuration file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rsdoctor": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@rsdoctor/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, you can interact directly with Rsdoctor's build analysis data in the MCP panel of Cursor, asking questions about artifacts, dependencies, optimizations, and more.
