## chunk:

In the context of bundling tools like Webpack and Rspack, a chunk is a collection of modules that are bundled together into a single file. Chunks are created by dividing the application code into smaller, more manageable pieces, which can be loaded dynamically or in parallel. This strategy enhances application performance and scalability by reducing the initial load size and enabling more efficient caching.

## module:

A module in bundling tools is a single file that is part of the application. This can include JavaScript files, CSS files, images, or any other type of file used in building the application. Modules serve as the fundamental building blocks of the application, and they are combined to form chunks.

## assets:

Assets refer to files included in the application's output during the build process. These can be JavaScript files, CSS files, images, or any other type of file generated by the bundler. Assets represent the final output of the build process and are what is ultimately delivered to the user.

## bundle size:

The bundle size refers to the final packaged size of the resource artifact after processing by the bundler. It is a critical metric for understanding the efficiency and performance of the build process.

## duplicate packages:

Duplicate packages are third-party packages that are bundled multiple times into the project. Identifying and managing duplicate packages is essential for optimizing the bundle size and improving application performance.

## concatenated module:

A concatenated module is a technique used to combine multiple modules into a single closure during packaging. This optimization reduces the overhead of module encapsulation, leading to faster JavaScript execution in the browser.

## initial chunk:

The initial chunk is the main chunk of the entry point, containing all the modules specified by the entry point and their dependencies. It differs from chunks used for "on-demand loading" and is crucial for understanding the application's loading strategy.
