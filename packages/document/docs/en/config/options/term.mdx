## Common terminology

### manifest.json

When your project integrates with plugins provided by **Rsdoctor** (such as `@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin`, etc.), Rsdoctor will write **build-related data** into a local JSON file:

- The **filename is `manifest.json`**
- The output path of this file is `output directory of the project/.rsdoctor/manifest.json`
