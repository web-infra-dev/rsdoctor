## How to use only a specific feature of Rsdoctor?

When we **only need** the [bundle size analysis](../usage/bundle-size) feature of Rsdoctor, we can configure the corresponding [Features](/config/options/options) option when integrating the Rsdoctor plugin. Refer to the code snippet below:

```ts
import { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin';

new RsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
  features: ['bundle'], // Represents enabling only the bundle size analysis feature
});
```

## Loader time-consuming data is inaccurate?

The time-consuming data provided by Rsdoctor for loaders is an **estimated time**. Why can't it accurately measure the timing? It's because we know that loader execution can be both **asynchronous** and **synchronous**.
Additionally, the builder will **parallelize the execution** of multiple non-conflicting loader functions. Since JavaScript is single-threaded, multiple loader functions can **compete for the current task queue**.
Furthermore, the asynchronous logic within loader functions cannot be recognized, causing a single loader function to potentially span across the execution of multiple other loaders. As a result, there are three possible cases, as shown in the following diagram:

  style={{ width: '250px' }}
/>

Therefore, the loader timing provided by Rsdoctor is an **estimate**. The timing data we provide is adapted to handle Case 1 and Case 2 from the diagram. As for Case 3, we are still exploring solutions.

## `out of memory` error when using `Rsdoctor` for building

If you encounter an `out of memory` error, you can try the following two methods, with the first one being recommended:

### Method 1

Increase the memory limit of Node, for example: NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8096.

### Method 2

You can add the `lite` field to the `features` array to use the lite mode. Additionally, since the `features` array overrides the default configuration when it is an array, you should:

- Add `loader` and `plugins` to the `features` array if you need build-time analysis to enable the analysis of loader and plugin timings.

- Add `bundle` to the `features` array if you need bundle analysis to enable the analysis of build artifacts.

The following example enables the lite mode, build-time analysis, and bundle analysis:

```js
const { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin');

// adding the plugin to your configuration
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new RsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
      disableClientServer: false,
      features: ['lite', 'loader', 'plugins', 'bundle'],
    }),
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

- Cause: During the build process, the source code information is stored, which exceeds the memory limit. Enabling the `lite` mode can alleviate this issue.
- Difference: The difference between the **lite mode** and the **normal mode** is that the **lite mode** no longer stores the **source code information**, only the **bundled code** is stored. Additionally, the code displayed in the analysis report will only consist of the **bundled code**.

## The loader of CssExtractRspackPlugin takes too long

When using Rsdoctor to analyze the compilation time of Rspack projects, you may find that the loader of [CssExtractRspackPlugin](https://rspack.dev/plugins/rspack/css-extract-rspack-plugin) takes a long time. However, this figure does not represent the actual time taken by the CssExtractRspackPlugin's loader; it also includes the time taken by other loaders involved in compiling this module.

- Reason: The loader in [CssExtractRspackPlugin](https://rspack.dev/plugins/rspack/css-extract-rspack-plugin) asynchronously calls other loaders during the pitch phase and waits for the callback results after these loaders execute. Therefore, the time taken by CssExtractRspackPlugin actually includes the execution time of other loaders and idle time.

## Next.js

### Issue with Next.js project report page

Initialize the RsdoctorWebpackPlugin plugin in the [Webpack Config](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack) of `next.config.js`.

However, in Next.js, when Rsdoctor is enabled and the **build command** is executed, the report server started by Rsdoctor will be disconnected. Therefore, if you need to reopen the report, you can use **[@rsdoctor/cli](../start/cli.mdx)** without performing the build operation.

For example, if the build artifact of Rsdoctor is located at the path `.next/.rsdoctor/manifest.json`, you can open the report page by executing the following command:

```bash
npx @rsdoctor/cli analyze --profile .next/.rsdoctor/manifest.json

```

### Loader analysis with rule override is not supported in Next.js

- Rsdoctor Loader logic: Since Rsdoctor modifies the Loader Rules, Rsdoctor wraps the Module in a Proxy to support Loader logic with rule override.

- Next.js specific logic: In Next.js, the LoaderContext adds the currentTraceSpan property, which is obtained from the value retrieved using the Module as the key. However, since Rsdoctor wraps the Module in a Proxy (referred to as ProxyModule), retrieving the value using ProxyModule as the key will result in no value being obtained.

Based on the above reason, Rsdoctor does not wrap the Module in a Proxy in Next.js projects, which means it does not support Loader analysis with rule override. If you encounter Loader errors, you need to configure the **[features](../../config/options/options#features)** parameter to disable **Loader** analysis. You can use the following configuration:

```js title="next.config.js"
const { RsdoctorWebpackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    config.plugins.push(
      new RsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
        // 插件选项
        features: ['bundle', 'plugins'],
      }),
    );
    return config;
  },
};
```

- **Options:** The plugin provides some configurations, please refer to [Options](../../config/options/options).
