#### Configuration

- Configuration Example:

```ts
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  plugin: [
    new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
      linter: {
        level: 'Error',
        extends: [],
        rules: {
          'duplicate-package': [
            'Error',
            {
              checkVersion: 'minor',
              ignore: ['chalk', '@babel/runtime'],
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

##### Type

- **ignore**: Configures the packages to be ignored.
- **checkVersion**: Refers to the maximum version level to be checked, for example: if set to `minor`, then the duplicate package will no longer check the `major` level differences. **Default is `major`**.

```ts
interface Config {
  checkVersion: keyof typeof CheckVersion;
  ignore: string[];
}

enum CheckVersion {
  null = 0,
  prerelease = 0x1,
  prepatch = 0x10,
  patch = 0x100,
  preminor = 0x1000,
  minor = 0x10000,
  premajor = 0x100000,
  major = 0x1000000,
}
```

#### Duplicate package optimization problem

Please refer to the [Duplicate Package Optimization Solution](../../blog/topic/duplicate-pkg-problem).

Clicking 「**More**」 can view the corresponding rule explanation.

### [E1002] Cross chunks package

The cross chunks duplicate package rule can scan **duplicate packages in different `chunks`**. These duplicate packages may also lead to redundant code in the build artifacts, depending on the business logic and the size of the redundant code.

- Display
  - Module refers to the module that is repeatedly packaged in multiple chunks.
  - Chunks are the build artifacts that are repeatedly packaged.

#### Solution

Please refer to [[E1002] Cross Chunks Packages](../more/rules)

### [E1003] Loader performance optimization

This module allows you to visually see some warning information about our project's compilation, which can help us further optimize the project's compilation performance.

#### Solution

Please refer to [[E1003] Loader Performance Optimization](../more/rules)

#### Configuration type

- **ignore**: Can include strings or regular expressions, used to specify the loaders to be ignored.
- **threshold**: Represents the total time threshold for the loader, in milliseconds. If the loader's execution time exceeds this threshold, it may trigger warnings or errors. The default value is 5000 milliseconds.
- **extensions**: Strings or regular expressions, used to specify the file extensions that need to be matched in rule checks. By default, it includes common file types such as js, css, jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, and svg.

```ts
interface Config {
  /**
   * loaders which should be ignore.
   */
  ignore: (string | RegExp)[];
  /**
   * threshold which the loader total costs.
   * @unit millisecond
   * @default 5000
   */
  threshold: number;
  /**
   * the file extensions which will be match in rule check.
   * @default ["js", "css", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "webp", "svg"]
   */
  extensions: (string | RegExp)[];
}
```

### [E1004] ECMA version check

This rule is used to detect incompatible advanced syntax. When scanning the rule, the configuration of `browserslist` is prioritized; if `browserslist` is not configured, manual detection is required, as shown below:

```ts
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  plugin: [
    new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
      linter: {
        rules: {
          'ecma-version-check': [
            'Warn',
            {
              ecmaVersion: 2015,
              // targets: ["chrome >= 53"],
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### Type definitions

```ts
type CheckSyntaxOptions = {
  /**
   * The target browser range of the project.
   * Its value is a standard browserslist array.
   */
  targets?: string[];
  /**
   * Used to exclude a portion of source files during detection.
   * You can pass in one or more regular expressions to match the paths of source files.
   */
  exclude?: CheckSyntaxExclude;
  /**
   * Used to exclude files by output path before detection.
   * You can pass in one or more regular expressions to match the paths of source files.
   */
  excludeOutput?: CheckSyntaxExclude;
  /**
   * The minimum ECMAScript syntax version that can be used in the build artifact.
   * The priority of `ecmaVersion` is higher than `targets`.
   */
  ecmaVersion?: EcmaVersion;
  /**
   * Used to ignore specified syntax error messages after detection.
   * You can pass in one or more error message types to ignore.
   */
  excludeErrorLogs?: SyntaxErrorKey[];
};
```

### [E1005] Default import check

Typically, Rspack automatically supports different types of modules, but in some cases, compatibility operations may fail. For example, when using `Default Import` to import a `cjs` module, if the module does not have a compatible statement (such as `exports.default`), issues may arise.

#### Solution

Please refer to [[E1005] Default Import Check](../more/rules)

#### Configuration

- **ignore**：Configure to ignore some imported files.

```ts
interface Config {
  /** Packages that need to be ignored */
  ignore: string[];
}
```

### [E1006] Module Mixed Chunks

When a module is included in both **initial chunks** and **async chunks**, the same module code is bundled into multiple chunks, increasing output size and potentially affecting first-screen load and cache efficiency.

- **Initial chunks**: Chunks loaded with the main entry (e.g. entry points, synchronous `import` in the main bundle).
- **Async chunks**: Chunks loaded on demand via dynamic `import()` or similar.

#### Rule details

- In the **「Module Mixed Chunks」** tab of Bundle Alerts, all modules that appear in both initial and async chunks are listed.
- Each entry shows: module path, **Initial Chunks** list, and **Async Chunks** list, so you can locate duplicated modules.

#### Common causes

- **Same module referenced in two ways**: The module is both synchronously `import`ed in the main bundle or entry, and dynamically `import()`ed somewhere else, so the bundler emits it in both initial and async chunks.
- **A file is both an entry and an async chunk**: For example, a utility module is configured as an entry and also `import()`ed in app code, so it appears in the entry’s initial chunk and in a dynamically loaded async chunk.
- **splitChunks overlapping with entry**: A path is split into an async chunk via `splitChunks` / `chunkSplit`, but that path is also an entry or a main-bundle dependency, leading to mixed chunk types.

#### Solutions and recommendations

1. **Use a single import style**  
   Prefer one way to reference a module: either all synchronous imports (in initial) or all dynamic `import()` (in async). Avoid having the same file both synchronously imported in the main bundle and dynamically imported elsewhere.

2. **Review entry vs dynamic loading**  
   If a file is both an entry and part of an async chunk, either remove one of those usages or treat the file as a shared dependency and extract it into a single shared chunk via build config, so both initial and async chunks reference it instead of duplicating it.

3. **Adjust splitChunks / chunkSplit**  
   Check rules for that module path in `optimization.splitChunks` (Rspack/Webpack) or `performance.chunkSplit` (Rsbuild), and avoid the same module being split into both initial and async chunks. Use `chunks: 'async'` or `chunks: 'initial'` where appropriate, or control which chunk type it goes into via `cacheGroups` and `test` / `chunks`.

4. **Trace dependencies**  
   From the reported module path and chunk list, search the codebase for references to that module, distinguish sync vs dynamic imports, then converge to a single chunk type or extract a common chunk as above.

#### Configuration

- **ignore**: Module path patterns to ignore (string match: if the module path contains any of these strings, it is ignored).

```ts
interface Config {
  /** Module path fragments to ignore */
  ignore: string[];
}
```

Configuration example:

```ts
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  plugin: [
    new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
      linter: {
        rules: {
          'module-mixed-chunks': ['Warn', { ignore: ['node_modules/'] }],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Linter type

- The type definition for the `linter` field is as follows:

```ts
/** Linter options */
interface Options {
  rules?: RulesMap;
  level?: SeverityString;
  extends?: ExtendRuleData[];
}

/**
 * Linting level
 *   - `'Warn'` runs only rules categorized as `'Warn'`
 *   - `'Error'` runs all rules
 */
type SeverityString = 'Warn' | 'Error';

/** Rule level */
type SeverityInput = SeverityString | 'off' | 'on';

/** Rule configuration */
type RulesMap = Record<string, RuleConfigItem>;

/** Single rule configuration */
type RuleConfigItem =
  // Only error level, this level has higher priority than the rule's own configuration
  | SeverityInput
  // In the case of an array, the first item is the error level, and the second item is the rule configuration
  | [SeverityInput, unknown];
```

If you want to **disable a rule**, you can set `SeverityInput` to `off`, as shown in the following example:

```ts
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  plugin: [
    new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
      linter: {
        level: 'Error',
        extends: [],
        rules: {
          'duplicate-package': 'off',
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```
