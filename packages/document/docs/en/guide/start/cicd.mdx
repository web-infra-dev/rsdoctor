# CI/CD Tutorial

In CI/CD, there is often a desire to upload historical reports to the CDN as historical records. Because it's not convenient to achieve instant use in the standard mode, the **Brief** mode is supported.

## Brief Mode

In Brief mode, data reports are integrated into a single HTML page, making it easy for users to view historical build data in a summary form within CI/CD and other scenarios.

### Enabling Brief Mode

<Badge text="Version: 0.4.0" type="warning" />

You can enable Brief mode by configuring the [mode.brief](/config/options/options#mode) option in the Rsdoctor plugin. After the build, Brief mode will generate a report in the build output directory: `[outputDir]/.rsdoctor/report-rsdoctor.html`. You can view the build analysis summary by opening the HTML file in a browser.

- In Brief mode, no code data is displayed to prevent the page from crashing due to large data sizes.
- The report output directory and file name can be configured. Refer to: [Options](/config/options/options#brief).
- For more configurations, refer to: [Options](/config/options/options#brief).

```ts title="rspack.config.js"
const { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } = require('@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    process.env.RSDOCTOR &&
      new RsdoctorRspackPlugin({
        // other options
        mode: 'brief',
      }),
  ].filter(Boolean),
};
```

### Differences between Brief Mode and Lite Mode

Currently, Rsdoctor has several report modes: `Normal, Brief, and Lite`.
