# Bundle Diff

<Badge text="Version: 0.4.5" type="warning" />

We provide the Bundle Diff feature, which allows you to compare and analyze the changes between two build bundles.

Currently, we offer the following usage methods:

- [Open locally with CLI](/guide/start/cli)
- Online upload analysis (planned support)

## Usage

### Open locally with CLI

First, you need to prepare **2 copies** of the [manifest.json](/config/options/term#manifestjson) produced by Rsdoctor. Then, install [@rsdoctor/cli](/guide/start/cli#cli-tutorial) and use the CLI command `bundle-diff`. For detailed command usage, see [command usage tutorial](/guide/start/cli#bundle-diff-command).

### Online upload analysis (planned support)

We plan to provide an online page for Bundle Diff analysis. You can upload **2 copies** of the [manifest.json](/config/options/term#manifestjson) produced by Rsdoctor on the page, one as the Baseline and the other as the Current. By clicking Start Diff, you can enter our analysis page.

## User Guide

### Feature Overview

In the Bundle Diff module, you can see the comparison of information between the two build bundles, including:

- **total size changes**
- **size changes of different file types**
- **initial bundles size changes**
- **changes in the number of duplicate packages**
- **changes in the number of NPM Packages**, and more.

In addition to the above data overview, we can also perform more in-depth data query and analysis through the **details list** module at the bottom of the page.

### Instructions

#### Dashboard

At the top of the page, we can see many data points composed of different cards, including the following information:

- **Bundle Size** includes the total size of the two builds and the change rate.
- **Total JS | Initial JS** includes the total size and change rate of all JS and first screen JS in the two builds.
- **Total CSS | Initial CSS** includes the total size and change rate of all CSS and first screen CSS in the two builds.
- **Image | Font | Media** includes the size and change rate of image, font, and media files.
- **HTML** includes the size and change rate of HTML files.
- **Others** represents the size and change rate of all other files not mentioned above.
- **Duplicate Package** represents the number of duplicate packages in the two builds. Clicking on it allows you to view the details of the duplicate packages.
- **Modules** represents the number of modules in the two builds.
- **Packages** represents the total number of NPM Packages in the two builds, as well as the number of new, deleted, and changed packages.

#### Overview

In the Overview module, we can see the **size**, **quantity**, and **change rate** of different **file types**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources/6c20c39a1dd576a513c2a7cb0fb0d2e162f63343/others/assets/rsdoctor/bundle-diff-all.png" />

#### Assets

:::tip
When displaying Asset names, Rsdoctor tries to remove the hash values from the build file names to facilitate comparison.
:::

In the Assets module, we can see the **size** and **change rate** of the build files.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources/632e3087495b569de77a93235196fdacf09627d5/others/assets/rsdoctor/bundle-diff-assets-list.png" />

By **clicking** the **"+" button** in front of the list items, you can expand to see the **list of modules** contained in the corresponding Asset (i.e., `Modules of "xxx"`), which shows the **size** and **change rate** of the modules.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources/632e3087495b569de77a93235196fdacf09627d5/others/assets/rsdoctor/bundle-diff-assets.png" />

Rsdoctor is compatible with the situation where Assets files have **the same name but different hashes**. However, for Assets with **different names generated by splitting packages**, Rsdoctor cannot identify their comparison objects.

Therefore, the Rsdoctor Assets module also provides a select component, allowing you to **manually select the Assets resources you want to compare**.

#### Modules

In the Modules module, we can see the **name**, **size**, and **change rate** of all modules contained in the two builds.

The `New` / `Deleted` / `Changed` tags indicate whether the module is newly added, deleted, or just changed in the `Current` build.

The `node_modules` tag indicates that the module's path contains `/node_modules/`.

On the right side of the list items, you can view the module code changes by clicking the corresponding "View Changes" button.

**Code comparison includes several types of data:**

- **Source Code: Source code data.** Available in `Normal` mode, not available in `Lite` mode, and not available in `Brief` mode.
- **Bundled Code: Built code.** Available in `Normal` mode, available in `Lite` mode, and not available in `Brief` mode.

#### Packages

In the Packages module, we can see the **list of all NPM Packages** contained in the two builds. Each list item includes the **Package Name**, **Version**, and **Parsed Size** (final size after packaging).
