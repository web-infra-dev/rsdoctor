# Compile alerts

We have integrated some capabilities based on compilation data detection. If the current compilation result contains data that hits the rules we define, the `Compile Alerts` module will appear at the bottom of the **Rsdoctor** main interface, as shown in the image below:

This module allows us to visually see some warning information about our project's compilation, which can help us further optimize the project's compilation performance.

## Rules

The current compilation rules include:
