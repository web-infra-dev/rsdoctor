# Compilation alerts

We have also integrated the ability to detect warnings based on compilation data. If the current compilation results contain data that matches the rules defined by us, the `Compile Alerts` module will appear below the **Rsdoctor** main interface, as shown in the following figure:

Through this module, we can intuitively see some warning information about the compilation performance of our project, which helps us further optimize the compilation performance of the project.

## Rules

Currently, the compilation rules include:
