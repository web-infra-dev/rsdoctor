## Glossary

The following table explains the meaning and code implementation of each phase in the card:

| Phase Name                               | Description                                                                                 | Code Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Usage instructions

### Bootstrap -> BeforeCompile details

By **clicking on the data of the `Bootstrap -> BeforeCompile` phase**, a popup will appear on the page, as shown in the following image:

<img
  src="https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/lognuvj/rsdoctor/docs/usage/overall/compile-overall-boostrap.jpg"
  width="600px"
  style={{ margin: 'auto' }}
/>

The popup mainly contains a chart:

- The **x-axis** represents **time**
- The **y-axis** represents all the **hooks** that have been **tapped by plugins** before the **compiler.hooks.beforeCompile** is called
- The data in the chart represents the **start and end time** of each **hook**.

Hovering over a data point in the chart will display the following information in a tooltip:

- **hook**: the name of the hook
- **tap name**: the name value when [.tap](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#hookhookmap-interface) is called
- **start**: the start time
- **end**: the end time
- **duration**: the duration, calculated as `end - start`

### Compile phase

In this section, you can navigate to "Compile Analysis" -> "Loader Analysis" -> [**"Loader Timeline"**](./loaders-timeline.mdx) in the navigation bar to view the timeline of loader compilation time.

### AfterCompile -> Done details

By **clicking on the data of the `AfterCompile -> Done` phase**, a popup will appear on the page, as shown in the following image:

<img
  src="https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/lognuvj/rsdoctor/docs/usage/overall/compile-overall-aftercompile-1.jpg"
  width="600px"
  height="400px"
  style={{ margin: 'auto' }}
/>

The popup mainly contains a data table that shows the relevant data of the calls. The field meanings are as follows:

- **Plugin Tap Name**: the name value when [.tap](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#hookhookmap-interface) is called
- **Hook**: the name of the hook
- **calls**: the number of times the hook is called
- **duration(total)**: the total time of all the calls

Scrolling down the page will show the corresponding chart:

<img
  src="https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/lognuvj/rsdoctor/docs/usage/overall/compile-overall-aftercompile-2.jpg"
  width="600px"
  style={{ margin: 'auto' }}
/>

The chart shows:

- The **x-axis** represents **time**
- The **y-axis** represents all the **hooks** that have been **tapped by plugins** between **compiler.hooks.afterCompile** and **compiler.hooks.done**
- The data in the chart represents the **start and end time** of each **hook**.

Hovering over a data point in the chart will display the following information in a tooltip:

- **hook**: the name of the hook
- **tap name**: the name value when [.tap](https://github.com/webpack/tapable#hookhookmap-interface) is called
- **start**: the start time
- **end**: the end time
- **duration**: the duration, calculated as `end - start`

### Minify details

:::tip

By **clicking on the data of the `Minify` phase**, a popup will appear on the page, as shown in the following images:
