Please note that this page requires the `loader` analysis capability to be enabled in order to display the [features](/config/options/options). The content of this page is shown in the following image:

## Usage

In the **Loaders Timeline**, the **left Y-axis** represents the **loader names**, while the **top X-axis** corresponds to **time (hour:minute:second)**. We can use the zoom feature and hover over the chart to view more detailed information about loader invocations.

There are two selector at the top of the page, where you can enter the **Loaders** or **Files** you want to filter, and the timeline chart will be displayed based on the filtered content.

### Viewing Individual Loader Invocation Information

If we want to view the **information of a single invocation** for a loader, we can hover over any **colored stripe** within the position shown in the following image. At this point, we can see the **information of the current invocation** within a single loader (refer to the [Glossary](#glossary) for field definitions), as shown in the following image:
