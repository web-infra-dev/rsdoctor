# Module dependency analysis

## Introduction

**Rsdoctor** provides the `Module Imported Chain Analysis` module, which is mainly used to analyze the dependency tree of a specific module, i.e. the modules that depend on it, similar to [Webpack's stats.reasons](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/#statsreasons).

In this section, you can analyze the imported chain of a module. If you have the need to split the package or want to see why a certain module is being imported, you can quickly and clearly locate the reference chain through the `Module Imported Chain Analysis`.

### This section's entry

Clicking on an **Assets** in the **[Bundle Size](./bundle-size)** page will display the `「Module Tree」` on the right side. Each **Module** will have the following icon next to it, click on it to view the imported chain of that **Module**.

### Glossary

- **`Reasons`**: As the name suggests, it means the reasons why a `Module` exists. Reasons indicate which other `Module`s import this `Module`, and the entire `Reasons Tree` represents the upstream reference chain of this `Module`, including both direct and indirect parent `Module`s. [Similar to Webpack's stats.reasons.](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/#statsreasons)
- **`Dependencies`**: The `Module`s that this `Module` depends on.

## Reasons dependency tree

### Introduction

The `Reasons Tree` displays the dependency chain of this `Module`, showing which other `Modules` directly or indirectly import it. In this dependency tree, you can view the `Bundled Size` of the `Modules` along the dependency chain. You can also click the right arrow `>` to navigate to the `Module Dependency Analysis` page for that specific `Module`.

- **Parent-child relationship in the dependency tree**: The parent node file is the one that is depended upon by the child node file and is therefore bundled into the output. Similarly, the grandchild node file is depended upon by the child node and is bundled into the output, and so on.

- The `Usage` tag displays the purpose of various module tags.

- The `Concatenated` tag:

  - The `Concatenated` tag indicates that the module is a concatenated sub-module. Hover over it to see which main module it is aggregated into. This type of aggregated module cannot be further unpacked, so the specific `Bundled Size` cannot be determined, only the size of the entire concatenated module can be known.
  - Glossary: A **concatenated module** is when multiple modules are promoted or **concatenated into a closure** during packaging. For an explanation of `Concatenated Module`, refer to the [Glossary](guide/usage/bundle-size#glossary).

- The `!` tag, hover over it to display the detailed path of the module.
