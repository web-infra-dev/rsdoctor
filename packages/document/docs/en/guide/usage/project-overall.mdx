## Usage

### View bundler config

If we need to view the Rspack or Webpack configuration of the project, we can click on `View Bundler Config` in the top right corner of the card. A popup window will appear, containing the serialized [Bundler Config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/), as shown in the following image:

### errors / warns

If the numbers displayed in the `errors` and `warns` sections of the card are greater than 0, we can click on them to view the corresponding details list. The following image shows an example using `warns`:
