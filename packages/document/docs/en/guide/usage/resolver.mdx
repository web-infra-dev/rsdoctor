# Resolver analysis

:::tip

- Resolve analysis capability is not currently supported in Rspack projects.

- The Resolver analysis capability is disabled by default. To enable it, you can add `resolver` to the `features` array as shown in the example below. [features configuration](../../config/options/options).

```js
new rsdoctorWebpackPlugin({
  features: [
    'resolver',
    // ...other features
  ],
});
```

:::

In the **Rsdoctor** `Module Resolve` section, we can see all the source files in the current Webpack project. By **clicking on a file**, we can view information such as the **module paths** imported in that file, the **before and after resolution path comparison**, and the **resolution time**, as shown in the following image:
